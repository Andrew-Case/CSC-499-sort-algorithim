To run the program, you will need to have a python IDE, I recommend Spyder. 
Leave the program in a file with the text file you want to sort name Sort Me.txt
as it needs to read that file and creates text files that can potentially overwrite other files depending on where you leave it. 
Once loaded into the compiler the program simply needs to be ran. 
It will then read the supplied file and create a sorted version of said file.

To run with tests run TestingScript.bat
